##  Features Overview

Here’s what makes this version stand out:

### Design Enhancements (No CSS frameworks used)
- **Glassmorphism-style container** — semi-transparent with backdrop blur, rounded edges, and soft drop shadows.
- **Gradient background** — vibrant colors create a modern look and feel.
- **Stylish input and button** — gradient add button with hover shadow and press animation.
- **Smooth animations** — fade-in effect for app load, hover-lift effect on tasks, and growing animation for checkbox toggles.
- **Custom scrollbars** — slim and minimal, ensuring long task lists remain tidy.

### UX & Functional Improvements
- **Task organization** — two sections: **Pending** and **Completed** tasks, allowing better task management.
- **Instant update on toggle** — clicking a checkbox seamlessly moves a task between sections.
- **Empty state messages** — friendly prompts when there are no tasks in a section.
- **Visual polish** — readable fonts, consistent spacing, and color contrasts adapted for both light and subtle dark visuals on the glass card.
